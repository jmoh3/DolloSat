## Duplicate each column

## If a entry has a 1, make the entry in that column 1 and the entry in the duplicated column 0

## If a entry has a 2, make the entry in that column and the duplicated column equal to 1

## Sort columns based on number of 1s, keep track of labels

## Construct trees by considering one row as a path at a time
